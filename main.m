%            ODE model for Omicron outbreak in New Zealand
%       with parameter uncertainty quantification via simple ABC
%
% This script reads in fitted parameters for a model without ethnicity
% stratification (see Datta et al. 2024) and runs a selection of
% ethnicity-stratified models with different ethnicity effects
%
% The population is split into 4 ethnicity groups: Maori, Pacific, Asian
% and European/other.
% This leads to 16x4 = 64 age-ethnicity combinations and so arrays of size
% 16 in the non-ethnicity model are replaced by arrays of size 64.
% By convention, these are ordered throughout as:
% [age_1 eth_1, age_2 eth_1, ... , age_15 eth_4, age_16 eth 4].
% The ethnicity groups are ordered:
% (1) European/other, (2) Maori, (3) Pacific, (4) Asian.
